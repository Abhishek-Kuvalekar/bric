# Bric
Bric is a text editor based on kilo.


### Installation:
```
git clone https://github.com/shnupta/bric
cd bric
make
make install (with privileges)
```

### Usage:
If you have performed a `make install` then just `bric <filename>`. It can be a new or existing filename. `Ctrl-Q` to quit, `Ctrl-S` to save, `Ctrl-F` to find. Navigate with the arrow keys (a better movement system will be implemented in the future).

### Todo:
- Git integration
- Line number
- More syntax keyword colours
- More language syntax highlighting
- More shortcuts (e.g. goto, delete line, append etc.)

### Contribution:
I'm completely open to anyone forking and helping build features of the editor so go ahead and make a PR!

### Bugs and feedback:
To submit any bugs or give feedback please add an issue on this repo.
